#  Insertion sort description

Short explanation of how this part of library works.

Main file :
Contains the insertion sort algorithm inside "solve" function.

2 more libraries are used : Timer and ArrayGenerator.

"ArrayGenerator" fills an unordered array of a given length with random ints (using vector<int> from STL).

Timer has some methods that check how long it takes to solve a function, I used them with insertion sort.
